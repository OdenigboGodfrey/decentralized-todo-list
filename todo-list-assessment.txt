back-end

use cases

todo lists
- create list
- view list

todo list
- add todo item
- cross out todo item

notes
- todo lists: i am thinking that when a new list is created,
  we can send that new item to the block chain, rather than the original
  save idea
- todo list: i am thinking, to avoid sending txn to block chain for every
  action, which for a todo list, there will be frequent actions, we can
  just batch all the updates at the end
- given the above two, we need the following endpoints:
  - create list
  - update list
    - this will simply copy over data from the client to the block chain,
      keeping things simple
- questions:
  - loading state for ui: i need to find a way to trigger a loading page
    for when sending something to the backend.  let's see if bootstrap
    has something.
    - use "react-loading-overlay"
